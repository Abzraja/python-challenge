CSV file contains a column for date (month) and a column for profit/losses.

The script I wrote iterates over each line in the CSV file and outputs the following:
* Total number of months in the data
* Net profit/loss over the period.
* Average change over the period.
* Month with greatest increase in profits.
* Month with greatest decrease in profits.
